#CodeIgniter - PHP/MYSQL WEb Application

If you would like to clone the code to your localhost to take a look at it, you should change the Database configuration
The database I used called fiteveryone, I put the sql script under the fitevryone directory. 
The settings in ‘fiteveryone/application/config/database.php’ must be set to reflect your local database configuration. 
The following entries are specific to your local environment:

```

$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
$db['default']['username'] = 'yourdatabaseusernamehere';
$db['default']['password'] = 'yourdatabasepasswordhere';
$db['default']['database'] = 'fiteveryone';

```
